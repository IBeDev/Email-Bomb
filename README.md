## Setting Up Gmail App Password

To use this script with Gmail, you must create an app password due to Googleâ€™s restrictions on less secure apps.

### Steps to Create an App Password

1. Open [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
2. Under the **"Signing in to Google"** section, enable **2-Step Verification** if not already enabled.
3. Click **App Passwords** (you may need to re-enter your password).
4. Select **Mail** as the app and **Other (Custom Name)** for the device.
5. Enter a custom name (e.g., "Email Bomber") and click **Generate**.
6. Copy the generated 16-character password.
7. Use this app password as the `from password` when running the script.
